# Attenuating-Bias-in-Word-Vec

The projection code returns for every vector u, its orthogonal projection from the direction of bias v.
Here, we assume that the bias direction v is 1 dimensional, for more dimensions, it is just an extension of the dot product.

The 2means code finds for two lists of names or words, the direction between them. Enter a data file in the numpy format for the vectors and the corresponding wordlist in the indicated lines to test it.
